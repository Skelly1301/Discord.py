# Discord Bot commands.
I have built this repo to help you with your discord bot, all commands a free to use with no credit needed - enjoy!

This is using [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), which is now no longer being updated. Consider using [Pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) with your discord bot instead, the commands in this repo will still work.
